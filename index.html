      <p>Open source makes it easier to contribute to projects because everybody uses same set of tools, 
      and because projects are based on a common platform. </p><br>
      <p>The goal of the hack day is to make you love these tools, so you use them all the time in your
      future projects. We will also cover talks from past <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/"> Google Summer of Code </a>participants, to give you an idea about the importance of these tools. For hands-on experience, we have prepared exciting problems in machine learning and web development domains that you will get a chance to work on (with the help of mentors!) </p><br>
      <p> Still not convinced? Github & MLH are among the sponsors of this event, and they will send goodies
      and swag for all participants. For web development stream, we will give away free domains (to show your progress to world) and for machine learning stream, you will get dedicated Azure access to do imaginative experiments! </p>
