    description1: >
      Open source makes it easier to contribute to projects because everybody uses same set of tools, 
      and because projects are based on a common platform.

    description2: >
      The goal of the hack day is to make you love these tools, so you use them all the time in your
      future projects. We will be covering talks from past Google Summer of Code 

      To give a hands-on experience, we are covering two main streams: mobile and web
      development, and machine learning. For both these streams, participants (with the help of mentors)
      will work on exciting, cutting-edge problems.

    description3: >
      Still not convinced? This event is being sponsored by Github & MLH, and they will be sending goodies
      and swag for all participants. For web development stream, we will be giving away free domains (as a 
      bonus) and for machine learning stream, you will get dedicated Azure access to do imaginative experiments!
