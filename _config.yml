  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "What is a hackathon?"
      answer: >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question: "How much does it cost?"
      answer: >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free.
    - question: "Do I need to be a student to attend?"
      answer: >
        Yes. Only students who are currently enrolled at any school of NUST or
        have graduated within the past 12 months are eligible to attend.
    - question: "Where is the event?"
      answer: >
        Venue will be shared soon.
    - question: "Are there any prizes for winners?"
      answer: >
        Yes, we are in contact with some sponsors to make sure winners are rewarded!
    - question: "Would there be food?"
      answer: >
        Yes!
    - question: "What do you mean by open source?"
      answer: >
        All the hacks that you build over the duration of hackathon would be shared publicly. This allows you 
        to develop your open source presence to impress your future employers.
    - question: "Is there a code of conduct?"
      answer: >
        Yes, we follow the one designed by MLH for reference, and we enforce it very strongly. You can
        [find it here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
